Rice Course Manager is a tool designed to help streamline the process of finding, selecting, and scheduling courses at Rice. If you see a <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign'></span> in the top-right corner of any page, you can click it to have the key elements of the page explained step-by-step. Detailed instructions for each page are also provided below. Course data is updated from Rice's servers on a daily basis. During peak times such as registration, course data will be updated much more frequently.
