Schedules are listed across the top in the navigation bar. For each schedule, the table at the top of the page shows your currently selected courses, as well as your total credits (including a breakdown by distribution). Courses are shown on the schedule below the table. Courses can be shown or hidden from the schedule using the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open'></span> to the left of each course. Courses can be removed by clicking the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-remove'></span> to the right of each course.

__Calendar__

The calendar provides a way to see your courses laid out over a week. Within a calendar, clicking on a course will bring up the course details.
Dragging a course allows you to view other sections of that same course. Dropping the course on an alternate section will switch the current course to the alternate section.

__CRNs__

The table at the top of the page provides easy ways to copy CRNs for use in Esther and other tools. Individual CRNs can be copied to the clipboard using the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-paperclip'></span> to right of each CRN. Click the `Export Current CRNs` button to bring up a list of the CRNs for all courses that are shown in the schedule.
