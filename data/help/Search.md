The Courses page is used to find and select courses. Initially the entire course catalog is presented, but the search bar and filters can be used to narrow down courses. Course details, evaluations, and comments can be viewed by clicking on a course.
Courses can be added to a schedule by dragging the course onto the schedule in the top navigation bar.

__Using the search bar__

The search bar provides a flexible, easy way to find the courses you want. The search bar searches for courses based on the course ID (`subject number`), course title, and instructor.

__Using filters__

The button on the right side of the search bar toggles the visibility of the filter pane. The filter pane allows you to narrow down results more narrowly than with the search bar.
