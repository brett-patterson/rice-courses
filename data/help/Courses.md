__Using the Filter Bar__

The filter bar provides a flexible, easy way to find the courses you want. Filters can be created based on CRN, Course ID, Title, Instructor, Meetings, Credits, or Distribution. These filters can be added by clicking the corresponding button above the filter bar or by typing the name of the filter into the filter bar, followed by a `:`. When typing filter names, the names are case insensitive and slight variations are allowed. For example, `Course ID`, `courseid`, `course_id`, and `course id` are all valid names for the Course ID filter. When using multiple filters, the courses shown are ones that match all of the filters.
