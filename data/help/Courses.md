The Courses page is used to find and select courses. Initially the entire course catalog is presented, but the filter bar can be used to narrow down courses. Course details, evaluations, and comments can be viewed by clicking on a course. Courses can be selected and deselected by clicking the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-heart-empty'></span> to the left of the course. Enrollment numbers are highlighted orange if the course is over half capacity, and red if the the course is full.

__Using the Filter Bar__

The filter bar provides a flexible, easy way to find the courses you want. Filters can be created based on CRN, Course, Title, Instructor, Meetings, Credits, or Distribution. These filters can be added by clicking the corresponding button above the filter bar or by typing the name of the filter into the filter bar, followed by a `:`. When typing filter names, the names are case insensitive and slight variations are allowed. For example, `Distribution`, `distribution`, and `dist` are all valid names for the Distribution filter. When using multiple filters, the courses shown are ones that match all of the filters.

__Filtering Notes__

* When filtering by distribution, both numbers and roman numerals can be used.
* An empty distribution filter filters for courses that have no distribution.
* When filtering by course, a dropdown of possible subjects will appear which filters as you continue to type
* When filtering for course meetings, filter values are interpreted as "`meeting_days` `start_time`-`end_time`"
