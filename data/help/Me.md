The Me page is used to view and schedule selected courses. The table at the top of the page shows your currently selected courses and the sum total of credits. Courses are shown on the schedulers below the table. Courses can be shown or hidden from the current scheduler using the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open'></span> to the left of each course. Courses can be removed by clicking the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-remove'></span> to the right of each course.

__Schedulers__

The schedulers provide a way to see your courses laid out over a week. Support for multiple schedulers allows you to have different courses shown/hidden on each scheduler and easily flip between these configurations. Schedulers can be added using the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-plus'></span> and can be removed and renamed by clicking on the tab for a scheduler. Clicking on a course brings up the course details. Right clicking on a course and selecting `Add Alternate Sections` adds all of the other sections for the selected course that do not conflict with other courses in your schedule. These additions can either be accepted or rejected using the dialog that pops up at the top of the page.

__CRNs__

The table at the top of the page provides easy ways to copy CRNs for use in Esther and other tools. Individual CRNs can be copied to the clipboard using the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-paperclip'></span> to right of each CRN. The <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-export'></span> to the right of the CRN heading exports all of the CRNs onto a separate page for easy access.
