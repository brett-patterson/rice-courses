The Me page is used to view and schedule selected courses. The table at the top of the page shows your currently selected courses, as well as your total credits (including a breakdown by distribution). Courses are shown on the schedules below the table. Courses can be shown or hidden from the current schedule using the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open'></span> to the left of each course. Courses can be removed by clicking the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-remove'></span> to the right of each course.

__Schedules__

Schedules provide a way to see your courses laid out over a week. Clicking on a course in the schedule brings up the course details. Support for multiple schedulers allows you to have different courses shown/hidden on each schedule and easily flip between these configurations. Schedules can be added using the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-plus'></span> and can be removed using the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-remove'></span> next to the name of the schedule (if there is only one schedule, it cannot be removed). Schedule's can be renamed by double-clicking their name.

The `Fix My Schedule` button provides an easy way to resolve conflicts in your schedule. When clicked, a dialog will appear showing all pairs of courses that conflict in your schedule. Within each pair, choose the course you want to be moved. Once the `Ok` button is clicked, the chosen courses will be automatically moved to different, non-conflicting sections if possible.

__CRNs__

The table at the top of the page provides easy ways to copy CRNs for use in Esther and other tools. Individual CRNs can be copied to the clipboard using the <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-paperclip'></span> to right of each CRN. Click the `Export Current CRNs` button to bring up a list of the CRNs for all courses that are shown in the current schedule.
